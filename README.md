#  Whats My Share

This is the beginning of an app where the user can add there shares and get the current valuation of the shares in their local currency.

to use the app the user needs to enter symbol, numer of shares bought, currency and perhaps date bought.

This is a learning proejct for me, so feel free to comment any code, should you stumble upon this repo.

This project was crested for me to understand the MVVM pattern.

remember to make an enum with you api key from https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key

 enum keys {
      static var api_advantage_key = "YOURKEYHERE"
 }


##ToDO:
- implement currency functionality, right now the exchange value is always 1.00
